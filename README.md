# EE810 Final Project: Algebra Solver (please run the main.cpp)
The program can calculate equations easily. It has three main functions to solve differential problems, integral problems and
multivariate equations.
For differential part, it can do the differential of the equation has one variable with power N,trigonometric function, exponential equation and do the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of them.
For integral part, it can do the definite integral and indefinite integral for one variable with power n. In definite integral part, it can calculate the value of a*x^b+c*x+d in the interval [low,up].In the indefinite integral part, it can come out the result of a*x^b+c.
For multivariate equations, it can solve linear equation with one or two variables and quadratic equation.
